## 👀 I’m interested in
- Embedded systems, Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32  
- Machine learning and neural networks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV)  
- IoT data processing and real-time analytics  
- Cloud & Edge computing  
- Web development (React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL)  
- Digital transformation & Industry 4.0 solutions  


## 💻 What you’ll find here
This repository contains my **university laboratory works** and **research projects** developed during the Master’s program.  
Each folder corresponds to a separate lab or coursework project — from **HPC programming** in C++ and CUDA to **IoT systems** built on Arduino and Raspberry Pi.


## I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open-source IoT or AI research projects   
- Smart factory / smart warehouse solutions  
- Data visualization and analytics tools  


## ⚡ Fun fact
When I’m not debugging code or building IoT devices, I enjoy exploring digital transformation trends and experimenting with **AI-powered automation** ideas.
